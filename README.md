# Binary Tree

1.  A tree consists of  _nodes_  that store unique values.
2.  Each node has zero, one, or two child nodes.
3.  One of the nodes is designated as the  _root node_  that is at the top of the tree structure. (This is the “entry point” where all operations start.)
4.  Each node has exactly one parent node, except for the root node, which has no parent.
5.  Each node’s value is larger than the value of its left child but smaller than the value of its right child.
6.  Each subtree to the left of a node only contains values that are smaller than the node’s value, and each subtree to the right of a node contains only larger values.

Some quick definitions that help keeping the following text shorter:

1.  A node with no children is called a  _leaf node_.
2.  A node with one child is called a  _half leaf node_.
3.  A node with two children is called an  _inner node_.
4.  The longest path from the root node to a leaf node is called the tree’s  _height_.
